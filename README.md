Final ALX Front-End Project Work:

Webstack Portfolio Project is a great opportunity, that I also call freedom, given to me to build my own project from scratch without "ALX" being strict on how to go about it.
My Portfolio Website Project is a sleek and professional personal portfolio website project aimed at showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing manner.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design and user interface, with a touch of clean design and very smooth navigation.
My major challenge was the time constraint while my greatest highlight was in maintaining code quality and organization in order to put up this amazing project in the end.
